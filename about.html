					<h1>About me</h1>
					<h4>My greatest love and passion is sleep. I don’t want to get up. The world outside the window may move, but for me it doesn’t exist. I lie there and think: why? For me, every new day is just another repetition of meaningless actions. I know that I have to do something, decide something, strive for something, but... why? I feel so good here, in a soft bed, where there is no goal, no responsibilities.

I don’t need to prove anything, I don’t need to run anywhere. I’m just here, for myself, with myself. Only sleep brings me some semblance of peace. There, in dreams, I’m not needed for anything. I don’t need to solve problems there, I don’t need to make choices. Only peace. But I remember that it’s 6 o’clock in the morning, and everyone needs to get up for classes.</h4>
